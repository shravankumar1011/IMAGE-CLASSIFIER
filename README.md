This project aims to build an image classifier using Python that can differentiate between images of cats and dogs. Weâ€™ll use deep learning techniques (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) to achieve this.

Features
Dataset: Obtain a labeled dataset containing cat and dog images.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split into training and validation sets.
Model Architecture: Choose a neural network architecture (e.g., CNN) for classification.
Training: Train the model on the dataset.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy or other relevant metrics.
Inference: Use the trained model to predict whether an input image is a cat or a dog.
